      Watch along as we program a virtual assistant that welcomes new users to your app, and helps them to set up a profile.
      We will define a series of steps that the user needs to be taken through, and then loop through them to collect input from the user.
      Then, we will pass that data to a new class that we'll implement, which creates an instance of a new user.
